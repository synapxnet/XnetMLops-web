## Build and Verification

Use the commands already documented in README and the repository build manifests. Generate artifacts only from this tagged commit or a clean export of it. Do not package local `display` worktrees, caches, `.env` files, credentials, logs, or generated build directories.

The committed `sbom.cdx.json` is generated from repository lock files and build manifests. It records software dependencies declared by this component; runtime infrastructure images and external managed services require separate deployment SBOMs.
